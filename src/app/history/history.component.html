            <p>St. Thomas, one of the twelve disciples of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ arrived at Mahodayapuram- the then capital of Kerala ( Kodungallur) in the year A.D. 52 and traveled and preached gospel in various places and <b>four Brahmin</b> families namely <b>Kalli, Kaliyankal, Pakalomattom</b> and <b>Sankarapuri </b>embraced <b>Christianity.</b> The history of Christian churches in Kerala had begun from thence, and it is a matter of pride to say that history of our family also begins from then onwards.</p>
            <p>The two families among those who received Christian faith, were bestowed upon <b>priesthood</b> and they were <b>Pakalomattom </b> and <b> Sankarapuri</b> (Sabha Charithram Page 79, 81, written by Ittoop Writer in A.D. 1869)</p>
            <p>In course of time, the members of Pakalomattom Tharvadu, divided into different branches and settled in different places and one branch from them came to Kuravilangad and settled there. The families namely Pakalomattom, Kudukkassery, Thumpassery, Panamkuzha alias Palliveettil, Manakkad, Kurialassery and Nidheerickal were some of them known to have lived with high reputation and integrity during the 17th Century.
            </p>
            <p>In the year A.D. 345, Mar Joseph, the 'Metran’ of Edessa, appointed the clergy representative 'Archdeacon’ to rule over the Malankara Nasranis. The first among them was the 'Mar Thoma’ hailing from the Pakalomattom Family. The Archdeaconry continued until the end of 17th century.
            </p>
            <p>It was in A.D 1653 (M.E. 828) on the 3rd day of Makaram Friday that the renowned, “Koonan Kurisu Satyam’ came into being. After this, due to the indulgence of 'Karmaleetha Viewers’, the religious atmosphere became dingy on the issue of the initial status of the Marthoma. The areas included in the 'Vadakkumkoor Rajya’ namely Kuravilangadu, Kaduthuruthy etc which were the strong hold of the Karmaleetha viewers due to their attachment to the monarchy, the strength of the followers of the Marthoma Metran became gradually impaired. In consequence of that, the members of the <b>Pakalomattom “Tharvadu”</b> and it’s branches, inclined their will to move to the neighbouring states. During that time, the Marthoma II, III and IV made their Head Quarters at Niranam, Chengannur and Mavelikara. Since it became difficult for the New families (Puthenkoottukar) to live at Kuravilangadu, Our ancestor Thommy, hailing from the Karavadasseril House, included in the Kudukkasseril branch of Pakalomattom Tharvadu, left the Vadakkumkur Kingdom, with his family and permanently settled at Vellikkara, Kavungumprayar in Kallooppara Pakuthy included in Thekkumkur Rajya in the year 1700 (M.E. 875 )with his two sons namely Chandy and Chandapillai. The elder son Chandy who was living in Vellikkara, started living separately in a house built nearer to Vellikkara under the name Karavadassery and the younger son Chandapillai lived in Vellikkara.

            <p>During those days the offerings such as ghee, oil etc. to the temple by the people of low castes were consecrated by the Syrian Christians, who adopted the traditional (order of) life of Brahmins. Such offerings brought to the Kallooppara Sri. Devi Temple were thus consecrated by Thommy, son of Chandy of Karavadasseril by a special order from Travancore Royal Kingdom and The Edappally Thampuran, the local administrator, supplied him a two storied building in the Templeyard free of cost and tax. On the northern boundary of the said property there was a big Peral (Pipal or Bo-Tree), and hence derived the family name “ PERALUMMOOTTIL”.
